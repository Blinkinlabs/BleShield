BleShield
=========

An Arduino shield for the s-power BG312L BLE module:

This shield is designed for the serial version of the module.

It has plenty of different peripherals that can be used to prototype your own bluetooth low energy designs: three buttons, one RGB led, and an output to control one digital RGB LED strip.

I'm making a run of protoype PCBs, if you'd like one (or like one+ a module), drop me a line!
