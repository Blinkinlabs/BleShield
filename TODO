For the future:
- Drop some functions, we're using all of the digital lines?

For RevC:
x- Replace crystal with cheaper version (3225 is expensive at RMB4, maybe 3215)
x- Figure out ground plane recommendation
x- Fix glyphs in Ledstrip, rgbled designators
x- Add connection status LED
x- Add software/hardware serial select
x- Add headers back, to allow reprogramming
x- LED strip move away from the edge (?)
x- double-check RGB LED (color assignments can change afterwards)
x- double-check RX/TX line assignments
x- Switch to higher quality button
x- Bottom silk? (got none!)
x- Move module to edge of shield (feedback from Sam- people yank on the center of the shield to remove it) (can't)
x- Make C3 footprint larger (6032)
x- Align to metric grid (.5mm)
x- Teardrops on vias/thru-hole pads
- Ask fab house not to include serial number
- Matte black, or just black (not a light black?)

For RevB:
x- Remove R2 resistor (design error)
x- Fix LED pinout
x- Replace crystal with SMT version
x- Figure out why A/LED STRIP didn't make it on the silkscreen
x- Drop RX/TX selectors
x- Teardrops on vias/thru-hole pads
