For RevC:
- Replace crystal with cheaper version (3225 is expensive at RMB4 in 3K quantities, maybe FC-135?)
- Figure out ground plane recommendation
- Fix glyphs in Ledstrip, rgbled designators
- Ask fab house not to include serial number
- Teardrops on vias/thru-hole pads
- Matte black, or just black (not a light black?)
- Add status LED
- Bottom silk?
- LED strip move away from the edge
- double-check RGB LED

For RevB:
x- Remove R2 resistor (design error)
x- Fix LED pinout
x- Replace crystal with SMT version
x- Figure out why A/LED STRIP didn't make it on the silkscreen
x- Drop RX/TX selectors
x- Teardrops on vias/thru-hole pads

Unknown status
- Fix RX/TX directions
- Any other problems that arise during testing.
- Add connected indicator LED/output to Arduino.
- Transistor on 3.3V line?
