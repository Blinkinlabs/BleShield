For RevC:
- Replace crystal with cheaper version (3225 is expensive at RMB4, maybe 3215)
x- Figure out ground plane recommendation
x- Fix glyphs in Ledstrip, rgbled designators
x- Add connection status LED
x- Add software/hardware serial select
x- Add headers back, to allow reprogramming
- LED strip move away from the edge (?)
x- double-check RGB LED (color assignments can change afterwards)
- double-check RX/TX line assignments
- Bottom silk?
- Move module to edge of shield (feedback from Sam- people yank on the center of the shield to remove it)

- Teardrops on vias/thru-hole pads
- Ask fab house not to include serial number
- Matte black, or just black (not a light black?)

For RevB:
x- Remove R2 resistor (design error)
x- Fix LED pinout
x- Replace crystal with SMT version
x- Figure out why A/LED STRIP didn't make it on the silkscreen
x- Drop RX/TX selectors
x- Teardrops on vias/thru-hole pads

Unknown status
- Fix RX/TX directions
- Any other problems that arise during testing.
- Add connected indicator LED/output to Arduino.
- Transistor on 3.3V line?
